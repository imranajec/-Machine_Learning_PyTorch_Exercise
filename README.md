# Machine Learning PyTorch Exercise: Terrain Elevation Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting terrain elevations using deep learning methods in PyTorch. The dataset comprises a digital elevation map, which we preprocess, analyze, and use to train a model for elevation prediction. Our approach includes data visualization, missing value interpolation, feature scaling, and model evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Scikit-learn

### Installation
1. **Set up Google Colab**: The project uses Google Colab for development to leverage its free GPU support.

2. **Mount Google Drive**: Store datasets and model weights in Google Drive for easy access and persistence across sessions.
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount("/content/drive/")
    ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional): Isolate project dependencies using a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    !virtualenv /content/drive/MyDrive/colab_env
    ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure all necessary Python packages are installed.
    ```bash
    !pip install torch matplotlib numpy scipy scikit-learn
    ```

## Data Preparation
1. **Loading the Data**: Load the elevation data from a pickle file stored in Google Drive.
    ```python
    data = torch.load('/content/drive/MyDrive/ex_dataset (1).pkl')
    ```

2. **Visualizing Original Data**: Use Matplotlib to visualize the digital terrain elevation map.

3. **Handling Missing Data**: Interpolate missing values (marked as -100) using the `griddata` function from SciPy to ensure model accuracy.

4. **Feature Scaling**: Standardize the coordinate features to improve model training using `StandardScaler` from Scikit-learn.

## Model Training and Evaluation
1. **Simple Linear Regression Model**: Implement a simple linear regression model using PyTorch's neural network module (`torch.nn`) to predict elevation from coordinates.

2. **Training Process**: Train the model on the processed dataset, adjusting the learning rate and monitoring loss over epochs.

3. **Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared metrics.

## Advanced Techniques
1. **Basis Function Transformation**: Enhance model accuracy by transforming features using basis functions and KMeans clustering to select centers.

## Visualization
Provide insights into the model's predictions versus actual elevations and analyze residuals to understand prediction errors.

## Conclusion
Summarize model performance and discuss potential improvements or alternative approaches for elevation prediction.
